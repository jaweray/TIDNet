# TIDNet Pytorch 
## Enviroment
The model is built in PyTorch 1.10.1 and tested on Ubuntu 18.04 environment, using following command to build enviroment:
> pip install -r requirement.txt

## Datasets
- `test`: Contains 112 images. Download [here](https://github.com/jaweray/TIDNet/releases/download/data/pretrained_model.pth)
- `train`: Contains 3627 images, The trainning data will be uploaded after the paper is accepted.

## Test
We provide a [pre-trained model](https://github.com/jaweray/TIDNet/releases/download/data/test.zip) for testing.

### Demoire
You can use the following command to testï¼š
> python test.py --input_dir TEST_DATA_DIR --result_dir SAVE_PATH --weights PRETRAINED_MODEL --gpus DEVICES_ID

For example:
> python test.py --input_dir Datasets/test --result_dir results --weights pretrained_models/pretrained_model.pth --gpus 0
